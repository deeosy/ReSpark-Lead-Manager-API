Lead Manager
This application can be used to manage Leads, it was built with a Node.js/Express backend and a React/Vite frontend. 
Create and view leads with details like name, email, status, and creation date. The backend is hosted on Render, the frontend on Netlify, and data is stored in MongoDB Atlas.

Local Setup
Youâ€™ll need Node.js, Yarn, and MongoDB (Atlas) to run this locally.

Backend

Go to the backend folder:cd backend

Install dependencies:yarn install


Create a .env file with:MONGO_DB=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
PORT=4004
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 ( or http://localhost:5174)

Start the backend:yarn dev



Frontend

Go to the frontend folder:cd frontend

Install dependencies:yarn install

Create a .env file with:VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4004/api/leads


Start the frontend:yarn dev



The app should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (frontend or http://localhost:5174 ) and http://localhost:4004 (backend).
